  <p style="display:inline;">In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote,
    previously
    unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns
    spoke perfect English.

  <p style="display:none;" id="more">One female unicorn was especially friendly, and the researchers were able to
    communicate with the animals. They even named her. Scientists recently discovered the first recorded herd of wild,
    free-ranging unicorns in Ecuador. The researchers were amazed to see the beautiful creatures, and it was especially
    surprising that the animals were friendly.

    Since their discovery, the unicorns have begun to slowly be released back into the wild, though one female is still
    being kept as a research subject.
